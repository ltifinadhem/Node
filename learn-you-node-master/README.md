Install Node.js
Run npm install -g learnyounode
Run learnyounode
learnyounode will run you through a series of Node.js workshops. Starting with a basic "HELLO WORLD" and moving on to more advanced exercises on dealing with synchronous & asynchronous I/O, filesystem operations, TCP, HTTP networking, events and more...

You have to solve a "minimum" of 6 exercises. (but obviously the more the better, no pressure ;) )
